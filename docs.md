## 1. System Selection and Setup
To select the most appropiate model for this project I have done a research of the state of art model in object detection tasks. Detecting a single-class object (ultrasonic probe) in drone imagery requires a model that balances accuracy and speed, especially for deployment on IoT boards like NVIDIA Jetson devices.

Key considerations include: high mAP (mean Average Precision) for reliable probe detection, real-time inference speed (frames per second) on Jetson devices and reasonable model size / memory usage. It is important as well that it has a manageable training time. 

State-of-the-art lightweight detections are YOLO family. I decided to take YOLOv8 and not newer version (v9-v12) because of their lower maturity and community adoption. (lower stability, community support, and reproducibility)
